## Philosophy

The updated system maintains the **skills-first approach** while adding crucial **personality and soft skills assessment** through ReelPersona. This creates a more holistic candidate profile that combines:

- **Technical competency** (what you can do)
- **Personality insights** (how you work)
- **Government verification** (trust and compliance)
- **Traditional credentials** (supporting evidence)

This balanced approach helps employers find candidates who are not only technically capable but also culturally aligned and personality-matched for their specific work environment.
